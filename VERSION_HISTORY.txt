Master branch changes:
-QU-fitting updates from Alec Thomson: sigma-clipping of posteriors,
    saving evidence to output file, option to not restart from scratch.
-Fixed bug in chunk reassembly script (assemble_chunks.py) where it would
    not figure out the cube size correctly when fed the last chunk.
-Updated RMclean1D to use new derotated angle equation for Observed noise
    (previously was using old flawed equation fixed in v1.0.2).
-Fixed problem with handling of degenerate FITS axes in RMclean3D

1.0.5: RMSF FWHM calculation fix   (13 Aug 2020)
-Theoretical estimate for FWHM now uses formula from Dickey et al 2019
    instead of Brentjens & de Bruyn 2005, as this is more accurate.
-RMSF fitting improved to be more accurate (previously would over-estimate)
-fitReal option for RMSF fitting now works as intended (previously crashed)

1.0.4: QUfitting tweaks + RMsynth3D crash fixes  (10 Aug 2020)
-Minor QUfitting fixes by Alec Thomson.
-Fixed crash when writing 3D cubes where all pixels are NaNs.
-changed output names for the QUfitting multinest files.
-Fixed crashes in RMsynth3D when input cubes are all NaNs.
-Fixed crash when RMsynth3D normalizes output cubes by Stokes I model.

1.0.3: Noise propagation improvements   (23 Jul 2020)
-Minor fixes to new plot-saving code.
-Changed theoretical noise estimation equation: Shinsuke Ideguchi pointed
    out that it wasn't correctly computing the error in the fractional
    polarization. Modified to normalize the channel errors by the model
    Stokes I (errors in the model are not accounted for). This will alter
    the noise behaviour for sources with steep Stokes I spectra.

1.0.2: Fixing derotated angle errors + Multimodel QUfitting  (6 Jul 2020)
-RMsynth1D: added option to save plots (pull request by Lenart Heino)
-Error formula for the derotated polarization angle (dPolAngle0Fit/Chan)
    was wrong (too small by a factor of sqrt(Nchan)). Corrected formula
    incorporated.
-Multi-modal posterior handling added to QU-fitting (by Alec Thomson).

1.0.1: Minor bug fixes   (12 May 2020)
-For RMsynth1D, the default Phimax value was previously fixed at 600,
    which was not ideal for high-frequency data. Modified to now be
    dynamic: 10x RMSF FWHM.
-RMclean1D was not using the noise properly when calculating derived 
    properties. RMclean1D error bars prior to this verison likely have
    issues.

1.0: Official release (1 May 2020)
